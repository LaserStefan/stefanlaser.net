[In 2019, there was an organizing workshop in Kassel](https://wordpress.com/page/stsingermany2019.wordpress.com/242), which I co-organized with Tanja Bogusz, Stefanie Büchner, Endre Dányi, Anja Klein, Martina Schlünder and Estrid Sørensen. [Julie Mewes gives a report](https://www.easst.net/article/report-stsing-towards-inclusive-forms-of-sts-in-germany/).

stsing is now an association whose mission is to strengthen Science & Technology Studies in the German-speaking world with new creative and critical methods.
