§ 1 Warning regarding content

The free and freely accessible contents of this website have been created with the greatest possible care. However, the provider of this website does not guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of the provided free and freely accessible journalistic guides and news. Contributions identified by name reflect the opinion of the respective author and not always the opinion of the provider. Simply by calling up the free and freely accessible content, no contractual relationship is established between the user and the provider; in this respect, the provider's intention to be legally bound is lacking.

§ 2 External links

This website contains links to third-party websites ("external links"). These websites are subject to the liability of the respective operators. When the external links were first created, the provider checked the external content for any legal violations. At that time, no legal violations were apparent. The provider has no influence on the current and future design and content of the linked pages. The inclusion of external links does not imply that the provider adopts the content behind the reference or link as its own. It is not reasonable for the provider to constantly monitor the external links without concrete evidence of legal violations. However, such external links will be deleted immediately if legal violations become known.
