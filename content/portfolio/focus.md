I study the material politics of global recycling networks, energy transitions and sustainability measures. My background is in sociology, and I published widely on relational approaches like actor-network theory, on economic sociology, digital methods, and interdisciplinary discussions in waste, energy and valuation studies.

This website is an example of a (minimal) intervention into material politics: the site is hosted on a low-carbon hosting provider, it uses a static html setup automatically deployed via GitHub, and content such as images [are highly optimized(https://squoosh.app/).

The goal of my academic research is the mutual arrangement of empirical casy studies, social theory and methodology. I examine the socio-ecological transformation from different directions, i.e. through multiple case studies. Across all cases, I am particularly interested in the materialities of transformations.
