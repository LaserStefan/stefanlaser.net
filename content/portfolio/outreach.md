I enjoy writing and speaking about my research fields in non-scientific contexts.

Most recently I wrote for an art project and was invited to speak at the German-Indian Society GÃ¶ttingen and the Theaterhaus Bochum.

I am also keen to rethink what outreach might mean. That's why I am also part of the [PECE initiative](https://disaster-sts-network.org/), that seeks to make research practices more open, and groups such as the [low-carbon research methods group](http://lowcarbonmethods.com/).

In the past I was active as a project manager [in an advertising agency](https://goldenezwanziger.de/) and also wrote journalistic texts.
