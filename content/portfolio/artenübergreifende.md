More-than-human research in the aftermath of the Corona crisis.
<!--more-->

I have been researching public discourses on the meat industry and the culling of minks in a writing collective. The book is based on a cooperation with students. Building on an excellent seminar research report, we knitted a book together; thus the project also stands for an egalitarian (social) science that thinks across statuses.

Beyond that, I have engaged with Cultured Meat in other animal-human research.
