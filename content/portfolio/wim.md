I was part of the initial steering group and now am a member of the research group [waste in motion](https://waste-in-motion.org) funded by the German Research Foundation. With Nicolas Schlitz [I've co-edited a Special Issue on frictions in global recycling networks](https://doi.org/10.20446/JEP-2414-3197-35-2-5).

On a global scale, I am cooperating with [the Disaster STS network](https://disaster-sts-network.org/) and the European waste research group behind 'Opening the Bin'.
