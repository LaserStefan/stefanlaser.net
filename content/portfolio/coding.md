From Data Science to Graph Analysis.
<!--more-->
In addition to qualitative, ethnographic methods, I work with digital research approaches. They enrich the qualitative analysis.
I specialise in the analysis and preparation of public controversies. I work mainly with Gephi, Python and R and focus on data analytics. See also [GitHub](https://github.com/LaserStefan).
