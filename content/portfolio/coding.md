More hands-on skills: From Data Science to Graph Analysis.
<!--more-->
In addition to qualitative, ethnographic methods, I work with digital research approaches. They enrich the qualitative analysis.
I specialise in the analysis and preparation of public controversies. I work mainly with Gephi, Python and R and focus on data analytics. See also [GitHub](https://github.com/LaserStefan).

Generally speaking, I'm interested in open science and knowledge and love to experiment with software, seemingly wasting many hours on testing and deploying setups. This is often connected with ecological matters, when, for example, it is about exploring the ecological footprint of data centres used for social media. For a collective experiment, see for example the [Disaster STS collective](https://disaster-sts-network.org/), to which I contribute.
See this [report on air pollution](https://disaster-sts-network.org/content/ruhr-valley-and-delhi-megacity-air-pollution-germany-and-india).
