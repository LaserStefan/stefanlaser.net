My research focus lies on the material politics of socio-ecological transitions. I study global recycling networks, energy transitions and sustainability measures. My background is in sociology, and I published widely on relational approaches in Science and Technology Studies, on economic sociology, digital methods, and interdisciplinary discussions in waste, energy and valuation studies as well as consumer issues, for example through the lens of human-animal relations.

The goal of my academic research is the mutual arrangement of empirical casy studies, social theory and methodology. I examine the socio-ecological transformation from different directions, i.e. through multiple case studies. Across all cases, I am particularly interested in the materialities of transformations.

This website is an example of a (minimal) intervention into material politics: the site is hosted on a low-carbon hosting provider, it uses a static html setup, and content such as images are highly optimized.

My goal is to conduct sustainable and careful research and to cultivate a different kind of science. This includes both reflecting on the planetary impact of one's research and valuing open and free methods and forms of publication. My work therefore appears primarily, though not exclusively, in open publications, such as Science & Technology Studies, Valuation Studies, the Austrian Journal of Development Policy, ephemera, and Cultural Studies Review.
